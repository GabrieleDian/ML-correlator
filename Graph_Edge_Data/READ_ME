# f-Graph Data

This folder contains CSV files providing graph data and coefficients for various loop orders. The data is organized as follows:

## File Structure

For each loop order `l`, there are two types of CSV files:

1. **Graph Data Files** (`graph_data_l.csv`, for `l = 5` to `9`):
    - **Columns**:
        - `NUM_EDGES`: Numerator edges of the graph.
        - `DEN_EDGES`: Denominator edges of the graph.
        - `COEFFICIENTS`: Rational coefficients corresponding to each graph.
    - **Note:** `graph_data_10.csv` is not included due to its large size (~350 MB), which exceeds GitHub’s upload limits.

2. **Denominator Graph Data Files** (`den_graph_data_l.csv`, for `l = 5` to `10`):
    - **Columns**:
        - `DEN_EDGES`: Denominator edges.
        - `COEFFICIENTS`: 
            - `0` → No f-graph with the given denominator contributes to the correlator.
            - `1` → An f-graph with the given denominator contributes to the correlator.
