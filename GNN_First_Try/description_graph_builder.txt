## Feature Space Breakdown (26 dimensions total)

### 1. Basic Graph Features (1 dimension)
- **Degree centrality** (1): The number of edges connected to each node

### 2. Face-Based Features (4 dimensions)
These capture planar graph structure through face analysis:
- **Number of faces** (1): How many faces (enclosed regions) contain this node
- **Average face size** (1): Mean number of vertices in faces containing this node  
- **Maximum face size** (1): Largest face size containing this node
- **Face size variance** (1): Variance in sizes of faces containing this node

### 3. Advanced Spectral Features (6 dimensions)
These use eigenanalysis of the graph Laplacian:
- **Algebraic connectivity** (1): Second smallest eigenvalue (Fiedler value)
- **Spectral gap** (1): Difference between first and second eigenvalues
- **Largest eigenvalue** (1): Maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian
- **Fiedler vector value** (1): Node's component in the Fiedler eigenvector
- **Eigenvector energy** (1): Sum of squares of first 5 eigenvector components
- **Third eigenvector value** (1): Node's component in third eigenvector

### 4. Dual Graph Features (5 dimensions)
These approximate properties of the graph's dual representation:
- **Dual degree** (1): Estimated degree in the dual graph
- **Dual clustering** (1): Clustering coefficient in dual graph approximation
- **Dual/original degree ratio** (1): Ratio of dual to original node degree
- **Dual betweenness** (1): Product of dual degree and dual clustering
- **Face-edge ratio** (1): Normalized dual degree measure

### 5. Centrality Features (6 dimensions)
Various measures of node importance:
- **Degree centrality** (1): Normalized degree measure
- **Betweenness centrality** (1): Fraction of shortest paths through this node
- **Closeness centrality** (1): Inverse of average distance to all other nodes
- **Eigenvector centrality** (1): Influence based on connections to high-degree nodes
- **Clustering coefficient** (1): Fraction of triangles around the node
- **PageRank** (1): Random walk-based importance measure

### 6. Laplacian Eigenvectors (4 dimensions)
Added by the `AddLaplacianEigenvectorPE` transform:
- **Top 4 eigenvectors** (4): Positional encoding from Laplacian eigenvectors
