00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:10.633
In this video we will focus on Two-Dimensional Tensors

2
00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.633
We will cover the following topics:

3
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:17.400
Examples of Two Dimensional tensors, Tensor Creation in 2D

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.666
Indexing and Slicing of 2D tensors, Basic operations on 2d tensors

5
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:30.300
A 2d tensor can be viewed as a container the holds numerical values of the same type

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.533
Consider the following database of housing information.

7
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:42.633
Each colum of the database contains features or attributes such as number of rooms, age of the house and price of the house.

8
00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:49.633
Each row represents a different house we can represent this data with a tensor X in 2D.

9
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:56.833
In 2D tensors are essentially matrix. Each row of the tensor corresponds to a different sample

10
00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:01.433
and each column of the tensor corresponds to a feature or attribute

11
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:05.433
We can also represent gray scale images as 2d tensors

12
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:12.566
The image intensity values can be represented as numbers between the range 0 to 255.

13
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:18.633
0 corresponds to the color black and 255 corresponds to the white color 

14
00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:26.100
These numerical values are stored as a grid like a database we can store them in a tensor

15
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.300
Tensors can be extended to any number of dimensions such as 3 dimensions, 4 dimensions and so on.

16
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.433
In this course we will also deal with some basic 3 d tensors.

17
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:42.633
A 3d tensor is essentially a combination  of three 1 dimensional tensors

18
00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.633
Consider a color image composed of three color components:

19
00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.933
blue, green, red.

20
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:58.633
Like a gray scale image each color component is made up of different intensity values that can be represent as a tensor.

21
00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:02.633
This matrix contains the intensity values of the blue channel in the picture.

22
00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:10.633
Similarly this one has the intensities for the green channel. And this one has intensities for the red channel.

23
00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.633
Now let's look at how we create a tensor in 2D

24
00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:20.600
Consider the list "a ", the list contains three nested lists each of equal size.

25
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.466
Each list is color coded for simplicity. We can cast the list to a torch tensor as follows:

26
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:37.166
It is helpful to visualize a torch tensor as a rectangular matrix, and each nested list corresponds to a different row of the torch tensor 

27
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:42.633
We can use the method "ndimension " to obtain the number of dimensions of a torch tensor.

28
00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:46.633
The dimension of a tensor is sometimes also referred to as its rank

29
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:51.066
The first list represents the first dimension of the tensor.

30
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:58.633
This list contains another set of lists, and that is represented as the second  axis or dimension of the tensor.

31
00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:05.666
The "shape" attribute of a tensor returns the number of rows and columns of the tensor.

32
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:12.466
The first element corresponds to the number of rows in the  rectangular tensor of A which in this case is three

33
00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:17.933
The second element corresponds to the number of columns in the rectangular tensor.

34
00:03:17.933 --> 00:03:25.200
The convention is to label the vertical axis 0 and the horizontal axis 1 as follows.

35
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.600
You can also use the size method to get the shape of a tensor

36
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.633
The numel method can be used to obtain the number of elements in a tensor.

37
00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:39.100
We see there are three rows and three columns in the following tensor.

38
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.633
Multiplying the number of columns and rows together we get that the total number of elements is 9.

39
00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:51.433
Lets discuss about indexing and slicing of 2D tensors.

40
00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:57.600
We can use rectangular brackets to access the different elements of a tensor

41
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.400
The following image demonstrates the relationship between the list representation and the indexing conventions.

42
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.633
Using the rectangular representation, the first index corresponds to the row index.

43
00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.833
The second index corresponds to the column index.

44
00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:20.300
We can also use single brackets to access the individual elements of a tensor as follows.

45
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.766
Let see some examples, consider the following syntax:

46
00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.866
This index corresponds to the second row

47
00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:30.633
And this index corresponds to the third column.

48
00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:37.266
And the value represented by this particular row and column combination of the tensor is 23.

49
00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:42.566
Let's consider this example, this index corresponds to the first row

50
00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:48.833
and the second index corresponds to the first column, and the value is 11

51
00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:55.600
We can also use slicing in 2D tensors, the first index corresponds to the first row.

52
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.700
The second index represents the first two columns and we extract the elements 11 and 12 from the tensor.

53
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.766
Consider this example, the first index corresponds to the last two rows,

54
00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:13.166
the second index accesses the last column.

55
00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:22.233
Now, lets discuss some basic tensor operations in 2 dimensions. As before the tensors must be of the same type

56
00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:28.733
Let's start by adding two tensors. The process is identical to matrix addition.

57
00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:35.200
Consider the following tensor X, each element of X is coloured differently

58
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.333
Consider another tensor Y, and each element is also coloured differently

59
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:46.400
We can add the tensors. This corresponds to adding the elements in the same position

60
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.633
i.e adding elements having the same color boxes together

61
00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:57.433
The result is a new tensor that is of the same size as tensor  X or Y.

62
00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:02.633
Each element in this new tensor is the sum of  the corresponding  element in X and Y.

63
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:09.066
To add two tensors in pytorch we first define the tensor X

64
00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:17.600
and the second tensor Y. We add the tensors as follows. The result is identical to matrix addition.

65
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.000
Multiplying a tensor by a scalar is identical to multiplying a matrix by a scalar

66
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.700
Consider the tensor Y, if we multiply the tensor by the scaler 2 we are simply multiplying every element of Y by 2

67
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.633
The result is a new tensor of the same size where each element is multiplied by two.

68
00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:42.633
Consider the following tensor Y in pytorch.

69
00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:48.266
We multiply the tensor by a scalar as follows and assign it to the variable Z.(click 2) we multiply the tensor by a scalar as follows and assign it to the variable Z

70
00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:52.866
The result is a new tensor where each element is multiplied by two

71
00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:59.300
Multiplication of two tensors corresponds to an element-wise product or  Hadamard product:

72
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.633
Consider the following tensors X and Y 

73
00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:08.166
Element wise product corresponds to multiplying each of the elements in the same position

74
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:13.833
i.e multiplying elements contained in the same color boxes in X and Y.

75
00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:19.233
The result is a new tensor that is the same size as tensor X or Y.

76
00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:25.400
Each element in this new tensor is the product of  the corresponding  elements in X and Y

77
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:32.200
To perform Hadamard product in pytorch, we first define the tensors X and Y

78
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.166
We calculate the product and assign it to the variable Z as follows.

79
00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:40.733
The result is identical to Hadamard product.

80
00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:45.333
We can also perform matrix multiplication with tensors.

81
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:50.633
Matrix multiplication is a little more complex but let's provide a basic overview.

82
00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:55.500
Consider the matrix 'A' , where each row is a different colour

83
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.733
Also consider the matrix 'B' , where each column is a different colour

84
00:07:59.733 --> 00:08:06.066
According to the rules of linear algebra before we multiply matrix "A" by matrix "B",

85
00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:11.433
we must make sure that the number of columns in matrix A, in this case, 3,

86
00:08:11.433 --> 00:08:16.066
must be equal to the number of rows in Matrix B. In this case 3.

87
00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:23.266
To obtain the i-th row and jth column of the new matrix upon multiplying A and B

88
00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:30.633
we need to: take the dot product of  the i-th row  of "A", with the j-th column of  "B".

89
00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:35.200
To obtain the element in the 1st row and 1st column of the new matrix,

90
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.366
we take the dot product of the 1st row of "A" with the first column of "B" as follows.

91
00:08:41.366 --> 00:08:46.633
The result is 0. For the first row and the second column of the new matrix,

92
00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:50.633
we take the dot product of the first row of the matrix 'A'

93
00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:56.166
but this time we use the  second column of matrix 'B', the result is 2.

94
00:08:56.166 --> 00:09:00.066
For the second row and the first column of the new matrix

95
00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:08.033
we take the dot product of the second row of the matrix 'A' with the first column of matrix 'B', the result is 0.

96
00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:12.233
Finally for the second row and the second column of the new matrix

97
00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:20.133
we take the dot product of the second row of the matrix 'A'  with the second column of matrix 'B', the result is 2

98
00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:24.066
In Pytorch can define the tensors'A" and "B"

99
00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:32.866
we can perform matrix multiplication using the mm method in pytorch and assign the result to a new tensor "C "

100
00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:39.133
the result is the tensor "C" which corresponds to matrix multiplication of tensor  "A" and "B”.

101
00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:47.700
There are many other operations you can perform on 2D tensors in Pytorch. Check out the labs and documentation for more.
